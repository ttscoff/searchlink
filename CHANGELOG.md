#### Simpler syntax and new syntax options

* quotes no longer required around additional search terms
* if search terms in parenthesis start with a "+", they're appended to the link text for the search, otherwise they replace it
* A tilde (~) at the end of a single-string search with no bracket syntax checks the clipboard for a url and wraps the selected text with it if found
    - can be used with the `:` syntax at the end to create a reference with the selected text as the title
    - ignores and strips `!!` (link only) and `^` syntax

            # with "http://www.tuaw.com/tag/howto/" in the clipboard

            TUAW how-to~
            => [TUAW how-to](http://www.tuaw.com/tag/howto/)

            TUAW how-to:~ (or "TUAW how-to~:")
            => [TUAW how-to]: http://www.tuaw.com/tag/howto/

- !example.com searches become site-specific web searches
- for single-line searches, text in parenthesis is searched (as additional search terms) but not included in the link text
- in single line searches without `[]()` format, text surrounded in quotes becomes the link text
    - `!g "Six Barrel Shotgun" black rebel` is the same as `!g Six Barrel Shotgun (black rebel)`
- !spell search replaces selection with most relevant spelling correction
    - works on entire blocks of text
- you can use a colon in a bracketed search and if it's alone on a line it will create a reference link definition
    - if an identical link results in future searches, it will re-use the id of the generated reference definition
    - if the resulting link already exists, any defined reference id will be replaced with the existing definition's id
    - the reference definition will be moved to the end of the document
- create footnotes with `[id](^footnote text)`
    - if id isn't specified, one is generated
    - footnotes are collected at the end and added with line breaks surrounding
- `!h` for searching your own web history
    - configure search types in ~/.searchlink

                history_types:
                - chrome_history
                - chrome_bookmarks
                - <del>safari_bookmarks</del> (currently broken)
                - <del>safari_history</del> (currently broken)
    - use `!h[sc][hb]` to configure on the fly
        - **!hsb** only searches (s)afari (b)ookmarks
        - **!hsbh** searches safari bookmarks and history
        - **!chsb** searches chrome history and safari bookmarks
        - **!h** searches all configured types from ~/.searchlink

#### New configuration options

- ~/.searchlink
    - config option to validate links (validate_links)
    - custom search definitions with a value starting with http or / and including $term in the string will simply have the value returned with the $term replaced with the input
        - `$termd` lowercases the text in the replacement string
        - More than one `$term` can be used by adding numbers after them
            - `$term1`, `$term2`
            - the search terms given are separated by a space
            - if there are more terms than tokens, the additional terms are appended to the last token
            - `$term1d` works for lowercasing
            - replacements are URL encoded
    - `report` option outputs verbose info on multi-line searches
- set configuration options with MMD metadata (per document) or flags (per link)
    - The following headers can be set in MMD: debug, country_code, inline, prefix_random, include_titles, validate_links
        - headers set at the top of the document
        - `key: value`
        - e.g. `debug: true`
        - Headers set in MMD metadata are global (unless overridden by a flag) and not removed from the output
    - The following can be switched per link with `--(no-)key`: inline,  include_titles, validate_links
        - flags are removed from the search and the output
        - values changed by flags are restored after processing each link
    - flags can be used in custom search engine definitions
        - flags in definitions are overridden by flags in the input
        - use this for applications such as never validating links of a certain type:

                # In ~/.searchlink:
                custom_site_searches
                    # lowercases the query and never validates
                    tag: http://brettterpstra.com/topic/$termd/ --no-validate_links

                $ !btt markdown

                => [markdown](http://brettterpstra.com/topic/markdown/)

    - Shortcuts are available for some flags.
        - debug = `d`, inline = `i`, include_titles = `t` , and validate_links = `v`
        - Enable options with `++[options]`, disable with `--[options]`.
        - Multiple options can be grouped together
        - both `++` and `--` can be used in the same link
        - only the first appearance of a flag is used, repeats are ignored
        - example:

                # do a google search for the link text
                # additional (+) search terms appended to query
                # no link validation (--v)
                # create an inline link with a title (++it)
                [Martha Stewart](!g --v ++it)

                => [Martha Stewart](http://www.marthastewart.com/ "Martha Stewart - Recipes, DIY, Home Decor &amp; Crafts")

#### Output formatting improvements

- link format only forces inline if a single line (no newlines) is selected
- groups new reference definitions with any existing definitions at end of selection to keep full-document selections looking tidy
- detects existing random prefix and continues pattern for easier search and replace
- duplicate urls properly re-use existing reference titles
- links in code blocks (indented or fenced) are ignored
- reports and errors are removed and replaced when running on a full document
- Jump to SearchLink Error service accepts a highlighted error line and jumps to its position in the document, highlighting the offending match

#### CLI improvements

- can run on a file if path(s) are passed as an argument (SearchLink File service)
- set `SL_SILENT=false` on the command line for verbose output
- `-debug` flag to output html comment at end of selection showing any errors
    - at end of line for single line searches
    - block format for multi-line searches
- `-version`
- `-help`
- `-stdout` outputs to STDOUT when using on files as CLI
    - default is to overwrite the file, `-stdout` cancels this out
- `-no-backup`
    - default is to create a \*.bak file when overwriting

### 2.1

- copy config options to `~/.searchlink` to preserve across upgrades
    - Config file is created on first run if it doesn't exist
- allows `[aawerg]()` for google search
- allows custom site search definitions
- allows `[](search terms)` (inserts title as link text)
- allows `[me](brett terpstra)` as google search
- better cleaning of titles
